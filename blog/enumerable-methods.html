    <p>When using Ruby there are lots of tools that one needs to learn.  But, perhaps, one of the most important sets of tools to learn are Enumerables.  Enumerables are methods that can be used on a collection of data like an array or a hash.  Enumerables can allow you to search for specific values, sort by specific values or select specific values. </p>
    <p>One very useful method I have discovered is the map enumerable.  Map allows you to pull all of the items in an array and change them one by one based on the rules of you code.  This is useful as often doing each do or another method means you have to create a new array, but with maps you can change the array values.  Take a look at the code below.  It shows how we can use maps to make all negative values positive and keep them in the original array.</p>

    <p>Couple of other things about map, it is non destructive naturally, so you have to include the ! after map to make it destructive.  I found map very useful and I hope that you do to. </p>
