    <p>Regular expressions, often stylized as regex or regexp, are functions that allows one to search a string or text for a specific set of characters.  Regular expressions identify patterns in the text which allow the for a lot of interesting uses. </p>
    <p>This pattern recognition allows for a lot of different uses for Regular Expressions.  It provides a potential search function, like in the find and replace functions in the Microsoft Office line of products.  It can be used to divide up text based on punctuation or specific words or characters. </p>
    <p>Regualr expressions can also be used in a boolean function to validate whether text meets certain cirteria.  This can be particularly helpful when there are different spellings of the same word and you need to verify that the word is present for instance the word valor can also be spelled valour.  This same principal can also be applied when there are characters in one alphabet that arent in another, such as the german word Kaese(it means cheese) could also be spelled with an umlaut over the a, as in K&auml;se.</p>
