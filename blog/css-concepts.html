    <p>Every element you create in HTML has 3 major components to it: margin, border and padding.  To fully grasp how to shape elements and arrange them, one needs to understand these different elements and the difference bwtween each of them.  Margin is the distance from the border to the next element or edge of the screen.  It acts as a buffer around the element and affects how close other elements can be to the element. </p>
    <p>Border is the edge of the element.  Its what surrounds the edges of the element. The margin eminates away from the border and the padding eminates inwards from the border.  With CSS one can add color to the border, make the border solid or dotted, or not have the border visible at all.  </p>
    <p>Padding is the distance between the actual element and the border.  By increasing the padding on one side or another you can adjust the shape of the element, for instance making the element wider but keeping the text or picture inside in the same space.  One can also adjust the padding hieght and while the whole element will get taller/ the text will stay in the middle.</p>
    <p>By understanding all of these elements one can adjust the size of an element, its position in regards to other elements, the location of content inside the element.</p>
