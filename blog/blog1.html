          Version Control

        <p>What are the benefits of version control?  Week 1 has been a good stepping off point for getting into the DBC program, I’d like to highlight a few of the concepts that I have learned this week; version control, git and Github.  Version control allows you or a group to view changes that are made and track the different versions of a project.  This helps to prevent errors and to allow each other to see what each other person is working on.  Version control also allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interrupting each other’s work.</p>
        <p>How does git help you keep track of changes? Git allows one to see what changes they have made, using git status. From there one can decide what changes one wants to make with git add and git commit, and then push the changes you want to make to the repository.</p>
        <p>Why use GitHub to store your code?  Github is a great tool to track the versions of code that you have saved.  It allows you to add titles and descriptions to each variation of your code, that can help to manage your project.  It also allows one to easily share their work with others to collaborate or check ones work.  It helps to allow for simultaneous work on the same code while providing version control at the same time.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, I’ve learned  a lot this week and hope I have been to explain some of what I learned.</p>
