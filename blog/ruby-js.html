    <p>When switching between Ruby and Jaavascript there are a number differences that one encounters.  One of these that I would like to highlight is the difference you encounter while iterating over objects </p>
    <p>While using ruby there are a number of built in tools to help you iterate over objects but the most common one is the each function.  By calling on the object you want to iterate over and then typing .each {|x| thing to do } you can input your code take a look at the first example below.  Here the x is the individual element you will be iterating over each time the program runs the each method.</p>

    <p>When using Javascript there is a little less flexibility in how one can iterate over arrays.  One needs to use a for loop that looks like this for (var i = 0; i &#8249 object.length; i++) {}).  Inside your curly brackets you will then reference the item you want to iterate over with i as a reference and then the code you want to perform.  Take a look at the example below.</p>

    <p>While these two different methods will produce the same results there are some clear differences.  There is some more built in capacities in Ruby, while in Javascript we have to use for and use the i value as a counter to iterate through each element.</p>
