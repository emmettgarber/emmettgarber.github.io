    <p>So far the code we have worked with has just involved a single method.  This is great but what if we want to create  a program that needs to do multiple things.  When this is the case we utilize something called a class.  Classes allow us to run multiple methods and to create instance variables which can be used throught a class. </p>
    <p>Instance variables are variables that can be used throughout a class.  They are identified by an @ sign in front of the variable ie @variable. These are useful because you may want to perform multiple things on a single variables but in different methods.  Or you may want to create a variable in one method and call it another, and instance variables will allow you to do that</p>

    <p>When using classes, to run our test code we need to do something a little differnt.  You need to call an instance of the class (check out the example above) with name = Class.new, and then you use name.method to call the individual methods.</p>
