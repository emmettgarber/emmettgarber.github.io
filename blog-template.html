How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a pretty comfortable process.  I think that wireframing before hand makes the process of writing the code
with a partner much easier.  By having that visual element of what we wanted to create allowed us to collaborate much
more effectivly and kept us on task for what our next steps were.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I found wireframing very helpful.  It was nice to have a visual element to guide your code and give you a goal to work for.
It also greatly aided the process when working with a partner, as it helped to focus each persons efforts into one task and
prevented miscommunication on ideas.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A design that was clear and concise that was not too cluttered.  Enough information to give the shape and design that we wanted,
but also didnt make things too complicated
.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
N/A
