There are a lot of factors involved in getting elements into the correct place.  Borders, padding, and margin can affect an elements location

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
There are a lot of factors to be taken into consideration, from display, position, float.  All of these factors have to be considered
to get the site to look the way one hopes for.  This is definitely something that I need to work on in the future, as there are times
that elements still do not behave the way I expect them to.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I think size, color and background are the easiest elements to implement.  The concepts behind these are all fairly straightforward and there
is not much difficulty in executing them.  On the other hand, getting every element to position its self with the page correctly, both in regards 
to other elemetns and overall screen size was difficult.  I definitely need to go back and fix some things on my site, as there are several elements that
probalby need a size change an adjustments based on screen size.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
One needs to think about a variety of factors from beginning to end.  If one writes HTML could in a less than optimal way
completing the CSS to create the right look can be very difficult and time consuming.  Once you move to the CSS you need to consider 
all of the elements you are working on and decide the best way to set them all up in relation to each other.  If one can properly conceptualize in 
the beginning you will have the msot success.
